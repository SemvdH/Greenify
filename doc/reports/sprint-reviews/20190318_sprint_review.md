# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Daan will quit CSE
Since Daan will quit the study, we'll work with four people from now on 

## Adjustments from previous sprints
If we start working on the demo a bit earlier and do a little less research, we'll have 
a little less stress in the end.

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Group made out of four
 - Start implemention a bit earlier
