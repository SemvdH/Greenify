### G – Goal
After completing this project, I want to be able to work on a programming project efficiently with other people. I have never attempted anything of this scale and find that it is a core requirement of becoming a good programmer, as in most companies programming is done within teams, not alone. 

### R – Reality
With this project I hope to work towards this goal. I have never programmed as a team on this scale, so this project will be the first step towards my goal. 

### O – Options
During this quarter the project will be my only option towards achieving this goal. If I am unhappy with my progress towards my goal by the end of this quarter, I must try to implement the same structure of teamwork in my next projects, and try to learn from the mistakes I made when working as a team in this project.

### W – Will
I will try to make sure to adhere to the structure we establish as a group which describes how we will work together. This way, we all do the work we are supposed to do, and none of us will be overloaded with work. I will also try to make use of all the tools available to us which can improve the quality of programming together (scrum, git, GitLab etc.).
