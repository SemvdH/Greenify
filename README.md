### G – Goal
After completing this project, I want to be able to work on a programming project efficiently with other people. I have never attempted anything of this scale and find that it is a core requirement of becoming a good programmer, as in most companies programming is done within teams, not alone. 

### R – Reality
With this project I hope to work towards this goal. I have never programmed as a team on this scale, so this project will be the first step towards my goal. 

### O – Options
During this quarter the project will be my only option towards achieving this goal. If I am unhappy with my progress towards my goal by the end of this quarter, I must try to implement the same structure of teamwork in my next projects, and try to learn from the mistakes I made when working as a team in this project.

### W – Will
I will try to make sure to adhere to the structure we establish as a group which describes how we will work together. This way, we all do the work we are supposed to do, and none of us will be overloaded with work. I will also try to make use of all the tools available to us which can improve the quality of programming together (scrum, git, GitLab etc.).

##Personal Development Plan

My strong points:
1.	I’m a natural leader. I like to know how everyone is doing, if 
everyone is keeping on track and if not, why is someone slacking?
2.	I keep my promises. If I say I will do something, I do it. 

What are two of your weaker points?
1.	I’m a bit of a control freak. Sometimes I find it hard to let other people do things and to mind my own business. 
2.	I’m competitive. This can be a good thing, because I’m very passionate and really give it 100% if I like something, but it can also lead to hurt feelings when I’m not paying attention.

###    G - Goal
I want to improve on letting other people handle things that I actually want to do myself. I also want to improve my programming and am aiming to not make it a competition, but to really make it a group project. This is important, because you almost never work alone in software developing, which is what I want to do after the studies. 
    
###    R - Reality (Your current situation)
I’ve already been working on my teamwork skills since high school. I had a subject that had only projects. I’ve also worked with Scrum before, which really helps you focus on your development without letting your project out of sight. I’m better at working together and listening to tips than I was before. 

###    O - Options (Look at possible options)
Actively watching myself and letting my teammates know that they need to be clear with me if they don’t like something I say or do are the best ways for me to improve. I would rather improve by myself, but for my goals it is better to let my team guide me. It’s about teamwork after all.

###     W - Will (Motivation, plan of action)
I’m just going to keep working on myself and hope my teammates will work with me. It also helps to work in different teams to get a much more diverse experience. Every team is different, so I’m just going to wait what this team will bring me and how I will have to adjust myself to make the team efficient.

### G - Goal
My goal with this project is most of all to be able to efficiently work with a group of people. This is important to me because  I have not worked on a (development) project with a (big) group of people before. I believe I have succeeded in this goal when our project is finished and we have got a passing grade.

### R - Reality
With this project I am already setting the first step towards reaching my goal, as we have already started working as a group. 

### O - Options
The options I have to reach my goal are basically this project, as this is the only big project we will be doing as a team in this year. I want to obviously try to learn as much as I can during this project, especially abour working in a group. The only thing I think would be stopping this is if members of the group had different opinions on how things should be done. but so far everyone is on the same track :D.

### W - Will
I am going to try my hardest to follow the rules we have set up, and to deliver everything I am supposed to. I will try to do this everytime I get the chance to do so. Right now the first step I can take is to work on this personal development plan, so that I already have my part of what we needed to do finished. My teammates can help me achieve this goal by helping if I have questions or don't understand something/am getting stuck with something.
action plan:
⋅⋅* finish my part of the readme we have to finish 
⋅⋅* try to keep up with what needs to be done
⋅⋅* don't be hesitant on asking people for help
⋅⋅* deliver things I need to do on time
