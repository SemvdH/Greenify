# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Kristin left the group
Kristin does not continue CSE and left our group. We'll work with five people from now on.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
We created the backlog before the sprint, which helps making clear what we're working on.

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Group made out of five
 - Backlogs ready on time
