## Personal Development Plan

My Core Quadrant is visible ![here](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2018-2019/oopp-group-43/template/blob/master/Pictures%20Group%20Members/Daan_Sneep_PDP_Core_Quadrant.PNG)

### G – Goal
After completing this project, I want to be able to work on a programming project efficiently with other people. I have never attempted anything of this scale and find that it is a core requirement of becoming a good programmer, as in most companies programming is done within teams, not alone. 

### R – Reality
With this project I hope to work towards this goal. I have never programmed as a team on this scale, so this project will be the first step towards my goal. 

### O – Options
During this quarter the project will be my only option towards achieving this goal. If I am unhappy with my progress towards my goal by the end of this quarter, I must try to implement the same structure of teamwork in my next projects, and try to learn from the mistakes I made when working as a team in this project.

### W – Will
I will try to make sure to adhere to the structure we establish as a group which describes how we will work together. This way, we all do the work we are supposed to do, and none of us will be overloaded with work. I will also try to make use of all the tools available to us which can improve the quality of programming together (scrum, git, GitLab etc.).

### G - Goal
My goal with this project is most of all to be able to efficiently work with a group of people. This is important to me because  I have not worked on a (development) project with a (big) group of people before. I believe I have succeeded in this goal when our project is finished and we have got a passing grade.

### R - Reality
With this project I am already setting the first step towards reaching my goal, as we have already started working as a group. 

### O - Options
The options I have to reach my goal are basically this project, as this is the only big project we will be doing as a team in this year. I want to obviously try to learn as much as I can during this project, especially abour working in a group. The only thing I think would be stopping this is if members of the group had different opinions on how things should be done. but so far everyone is on the same track :D.

### W - Will
I am going to try my hardest to follow the rules we have set up, and to deliver everything I am supposed to. I will try to do this everytime I get the chance to do so. Right now the first step I can take is to work on this personal development plan, so that I already have my part of what we needed to do finished. My teammates can help me achieve this goal by helping if I have questions or don't understand something/am getting stuck with something.
action plan:
⋅⋅* finish my part of the readme we have to finish 
⋅⋅* try to keep up with what needs to be done
⋅⋅* don't be hesitant on asking people for help
⋅⋅* deliver things I need to do on time
