# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: We had some bugs
because of some bugs in the server, things did not work as intended. Ceren fixed it.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
Write all we still need to do down, even if the things are not necessarily assigned to a specific person yet.

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Write down all other necessary tasks.
